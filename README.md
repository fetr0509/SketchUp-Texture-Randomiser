 SketchUp Texture Randomiser
 
This simple SketchUp plugin randomizes the textures of the selected faces of an object or multiple objects. 

This plugin was written as a way to expose myself to the Ruby programming language. This plugin works in conjunction
with the popular Architectural Design program SketchUp. The idea for this project came from an architect friend of
mine who told me about the  tedious process of changing the texture positions by hand. Though I'm sure the 
functionality found in this plugin exists in some capacity in another plugin, this was created strictly for 
a friend (and whomever might find it useful) and as an exercise to familiarize myself with Ruby.
