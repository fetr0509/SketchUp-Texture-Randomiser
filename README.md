# SketchUp Texture Randomiser
 
## About
This SketchUp plugin randomizes the textures of the selected faces of an object or multiple objects. 

This plugin was written as a way to expose myself to the Ruby programming language. This plugin works in conjunction
with the popular Architectural Design program SketchUp. 

The idea for this project originated when an acquaintance who is an architect told me about the tedious process of changing 
the texture positions on the visible face of a building by hand.
